Adapted from https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF

## Dependencies

You should download the latest binaries from https://github.com/facebookincubator/FBX2glTF/releases.
Once downloaded, you should `chmod 755` the file and move into your `PATH` directory (such as `/usr/local/bin`).

## Build

Before you can use the Schematic within the Mono-repo, you will need to build the typescript.
You can do this by running `yarn build` within `./tools/executors/fbx2gltf`.
